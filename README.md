```lrc
[00:07.70] Kiss me, keep those lips from wandering off
[00:11.29] Tell me every sweet and tender thought!
[00:14.92] Give me all you have to give and more
[00:18.49] Fantasy's where futures are born!
[00:34.99] 
[00:21.95] Can you feel the beat, the rhythm, the tune
[00:25.52] Your heart and mine, the countdown?
[00:29.01] If you feel something coming to you
[00:32.72] Believe it and scream it aloud!
[00:48.22] 
[00:37.79] I don't think I'll miss you anymore like I did the day you left
[00:41.77] There's so many just like you, I could use instead
[00:45.65] 'Cause passion's burning bright only hurts you in the end
[00:49.24] This city will swallow the pain
[00:52.91] Tomorrow's another today
[01:04.91] 
[00:57.15] Curtain calls at dawn, darling, showtime
[01:00.50] Spend our moment dancing in the moonlight
[01:04.38] 'Til your gaze starts swaying with my body
[01:08.06] Keep your eyes on me
[01:18.06] 
[01:11.28] Take me somewhere, deep into the night
[01:14.94] Touch me, here, there, anywhere you like
[01:18.38] Trust me, won't you let me look inside?
[01:22.12] Fantasies and futures collide
[01:36.62] 
[01:25.75] It's just the two of us beneath the starry sky
[01:48.75] 
[01:32.36] If the only way to keep on living is keep on living strong
[01:36.41] Then you can keep the kindness 'cause I'm moving on
[01:40.15] No need to say goodbye to me, I'm already gone
[01:43.85] Just wipe all your tears away
[01:47.33] And know we'll start over someday
[02:03.83] 
[02:05.68] All your heart, your soul, your body
[02:09.34] You belong to one and only
[02:13.09] Unconditionally yearning
[02:16.82] Knowing no one else will do
[02:30.32] 
[02:19.84] Can you feel the bond between us grow tight?
[02:23.68] We're closer than we've ever been
[02:27.36] Follow me, match your rhythm to mine
[02:31.03] And let it all out from within
[02:46.03] 
[02:35.83] I don't think I miss you any more than I did the day you left
[02:40.28] I won't say I love you, I know I'll take it back
[02:43.65] I'm used to this, I'm not the same old loser that
[02:47.45] Burned bright and quick when candles and wind could never last
[02:51.07] A city that's living in fast-forwards
[03:09.57] 
[02:54.52] The perfect place for lovers like us to take a chance
[02:58.21] There's nothing here to stop us when in Rome, romance
[03:01.91] And I won't let you leave me alone without a dance
[03:05.54] I don't wanna hear a goodbye
[03:09.26] Don't break the illusion tonight
[03:25.26] 
[03:13.42] Curtain calls at dawn, darling, showtime
[03:17.12] Spend forever living 'til the sunrise
[03:20.93] Feel that look even with the lights off
[03:24.41] Dance until we drop
