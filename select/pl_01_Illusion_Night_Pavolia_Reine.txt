Kiss me! Keep those lips
from wandering off
Tell me every sweet
and tender thought!
Give me all you have to give
and more...
Fantasy's where
futures are born!
Can you feel the beat?
The rhythm, the tune...
Your heart and mine -
the countdown...
If you feel something
coming to you,
believe it and scream it aloud!
I don't think
"I'll miss you..." anymore,
like I did the day you left.
There's so many just like you,
I could use instead!
'Cause passion burning bright
only hurts you in the end.
This city will
swallow the pain...
Tomorrow's another today...
Curtain Call's at dawn,
darling! Showtime!
Spend our moment dancing
in the moonlight!
'Til your gaze starts swaying
with my body...
keep your eyes on me!
Take me somewhere,
deep into the night...
Touch me - here, there,
anywhere you like!
Trust me!
Won't you let me look inside?
Fantasies and futures collide…
It's just the two of us
beneath the starry sky...
If the only way to
keep on living is
"Keep on living strong!"
Then, you can keep the kindness,
'cause I'm moving on!
No need to say "goodbye" to me
- I'm already gone!
Just wipe all your tears away
and know we'll start over
someday...
All your heart, your soul,
your body...
You belong to one and only!
Unconditionally yearning,
knowing no one else will do...
Can you feel the bond
between us grow tight?
We're closer
than we've ever been!
Follow me!
Match your rhythm to mine,
and let it all out from within!
I don't think I miss you
any more than I did the day
you left...
I won't say "I love you."
I know I'll take it back!
I'm used to this.
I'm not the same old loser that
burned bright and quick,
when candles and wind
could never last!
A city that's living in
fast-forward's
the perfect place for lovers
like us to take a chance!
There's nothing here to stop us
- when in Rome, romance!
And, I won't let you leave me
alone without a dance!
I don't wanna' hear a goodbye...
Don't break the illusion
tonight...
Curtain call's at dawn, darling!
Showtime!
Spend forever living
'til the sunrise!
Feel that look,
even with the lights off...
Dance until we drop!
